# MyPortfolio
Miller Boyd
This is my Portfolio that will hold all my work in web development.

This project is my incomplete portfolio, meaning I will add to it as I can. I have created a clean and slick design that is optimal for user ease. Not to mention the website is responsive and can handle any dimensions.

The goal was to finish a basic portfolio that I can use in my future as I develop.
